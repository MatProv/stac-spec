# STAC CARD4L Optical Extension

- **Title: CARD4L Optical**
- **Identifier: card4l-eo**
- **Field Name Prefix: card4l** (shared with the CARD4L SAR Extension)
- **Scope: Item**
- **Extension [Maturity Classification](../README.md#extension-maturity): Proposal**

This extension specifies how to create STAC Items that comply to the [CEOS CARD4L](http://ceos.org/ard/) product family specification for either
- *Optical Surface Reflectance* (SR) products in version 5.0
  ([PDF](http://ceos.org/ard/files/PFS/SR/v5.0/CARD4L_Product_Family_Specification_Surface_Reflectance-v5.0.pdf),
  [Word](http://ceos.org/ard/files/PFS/SR/v5.0/CARD4L_Product_Family_Specification_Surface_Reflectance-v5.0.docx))
  *or*
- *Optical Surface Temperature* (ST) products in version 5.0
  ([PDF](http://ceos.org/ard/files/PFS/ST/v5.0/CARD4L_Product_Family_Specification_Surface_Temperature-v5.0.pdf),
  [Word](http://ceos.org/ard/files/PFS/ST/v5.0/CARD4L_Product_Family_Specification_Surface_Temperature-v5.0.docx)).

**Document structure:** In general, the fields required in this extension are required to either meet the *threshold (minimum) requirements* by the CEOS CARD4L specification *or* are required fields in STAC. Any additional optional field provided may lead to a higher percentage of the CARD4L *target (desired) requirements* met.

The column *Field Name* refers to the STAC field names. The column *Req.* refers to the requirement number in the CARD4L specification.

**STAC Extensions:** This extension makes use of a number of existing STAC extensions:

- [EO](../eo/README.md)
- [File](../file/README.md) (optional)
- [Processing](../processing/README.md) (optional)
- [Projection](../projection/README.md)
- [View](../view/README.md)

**Additional resources:**

- [Examples](examples/) (ToDo)
- [JSON Schema](json-schema/) (ToDo)

**ToDo: requirements 2.3,  2.9 - 2.13 (SR only), 3.2, 3.3 and 4.1 not considered yet!**

## STAC Items

STAC Items must always be valid, but not all STAC Item requirements are covered here, only additional requirements and mappings to fulfill the CARD4L requirements are listed here:

### STAC Item Assets

Whether the metadata are provided in a single record relevant to all pixels, or separately for each pixel, is at the discretion of the data provider. 

Each of the assets can either be exposed individually or grouped together in any form. In the latter case the role names can simply be merged to a set of unique role names. 

The italic role names are proposed to be the asset's key.

##### Value Map Object

Value maps are used by assets that are used as classification layers and give details about the values in the asset and their meanings.

| Field Name | Data Type | Description                       |
| ---------- | --------- | --------------------------------- |
| value      | any       | The value in the file.            |
| summary    | string    | A short description of the value. |

 For example for a cloud cover mask, `card4l:values` property could contain the following data:

```json
[
	{"value": 0, summary: "clear"},
	{"value": 1, summary: "clouds"},
	{"value": 2, summary: "cloud shadows"}
]
```

## Notes

1.13: The algorithms can be given either in `proc:software` or as link with relation type `about`. One of them is **required** by CARD4L.

1.15: STAC only mandates to use `processing:lineage` to describe processing chains, but you may also include or link to a more machine-readable processing chain description such as a Dask graph, a openEO process or a SNAP graph.

1.17: Other data quality flags than `eo:cloud_cover` should be set.
